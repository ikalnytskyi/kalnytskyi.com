  Mad Map: Python Road
</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I use Python for several years and I used to think there was nothing in
the language that can surprise me. It was so until recently. The story
I want to tell is about how even so simple and well-known thing like <code>map()</code>
function can surprise you after years of using, and why I believe it has
a bad design.</p>
<p>So, what's wrong with <code>map()</code>? We use it everyday and everywhere, and it
seems OK, and none of us met any problems. Yes, indeed, <code>map()</code> works
just fine if you use it how it's intended to be used. For instance, if
you use <code>map()</code> to multiply each element of some sequence by 2 -</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Just keep going, everything's ok. But let me show another usage example -</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;c&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Can you tell now what is <code>x</code>, ha? I always thought that <code>map()</code> function
receives precisely two arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>a function to apply;</li>
<li>a sequence to be processed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you imagine how I was surprised when it turned out that I was wrong?
But the most interesting part was further.</p>
<p>I started guessing how <code>map()</code> should behave in this case. What <code>None</code> may
mean? I recall that if we pass <code>None</code> as a function argument to <code>filter()</code>
then it will return only those elements which are equal to <code>True</code> in
boolean context. Hm, Perhaps <code>map()</code> behaves similar to <code>filter()</code>, and
will return a list of booleans? Let's check.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>No, it's not :( So I went to the documentation and learned that if a function
argument is <code>None</code>, the identity function is assumed. In other words it's
equal to the following call -</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Wait a minute. <code>None</code> means identity?! Does it make sense? Perhaps if we're
talking about default behaviour, but it makes no sense from user point of
view. You know, it looks like &quot;pass <code>None</code> if you want to get identity
function behaviour&quot;. But let's go on.</p>
<p>I continued guessing about how <code>map()</code> should deal with two iterables? It
was obvious to me that <code>map()</code> should chain them: when first is over,
the second will be used.</p>
<p>Let's back to the original code and original question.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;c&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>What is <code>x</code>? Taking into account that was written above I was expecting
<code>x</code> to be -</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;c&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Boom! I missed again, because <code>x</code> was -</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">[(</span><span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;b&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;c&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">)]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And I stunned because that means these two iterables were zipped, not
chained. Why zipped? I never asked for this! Is this really Python?
I always liked this language because of good design and good intentions.
And when I didn't know something it always fitted my expectations, but
this is something really weird.</p>
<p>I agree that someone may expect iterables to be zipped, but I'm upset
about opportunity itself to meet such unobvious construction. I wish
<code>map()</code> to be plain and simple: receive one function and one iterable,
and leave zipping or chaining up to programmers. Moreover, I wish a
function argument to be always a function, no way to fallback to default
behaviour. If someone wants identity behaviour let's pass it explicitly,
no way to do it through <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing is that it wasn't removed in Python 3, but
changed! First, you can't use <code>None</code> as identity function anymore
(alleluia). If you try to do that you'll fall with <code>TypeError</code> exception:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>TypeError: <span class="s1">&#39;NoneType&#39;</span> object is not callable
</code></pre></div>

<p>Second, iterables are zipped by <code>zip()</code>, not <code>zip_longest()</code>. If the
first change seems rational, the second one is mad. It doesn't provide
any benefits, but may cause a lot of pain for those who porting some
software to Python. Why? You see, if two iterables are equal in size
the behavior is still the same -</p>

<p>if not, it's different -</p>

<td align="left"><code>[(&#x27;a&#x27;, 1), (&#x27;b&#x27;, 2)]</code></td>

</table>
<p>I'm really really sad about such a mad <code>map()</code> and I wish I never knew
about that. I don't know why it was designed so, but I hope none of
pythonistas will use it and one day it will be removed from the language.</p>
