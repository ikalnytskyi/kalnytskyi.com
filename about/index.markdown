About Me
========

Hey there! My name is Ihor, and I'm a software engineer living in Kharkiv,
Ukraine. I love Open Source and you can find my contributions in a number of
projects on GitHub.

In 2019, I bought my first pair of inline skates, and since then it has become
my #1 hobby. In my spare time, I read fiction and enjoy watching movies with
friends. I also like to travel. I’ve traveled to a number of countries in
Europe, crossed the Atlantic to the USA and hiked in the Himalayas.

From an early age, I’ve been passionate about computers. When I grew up, I
decided to embrace my passion and become a Software Engineer. For more than
eight years I’ve been mastering this profession, and throughout the years I
realized it’s a never ending study. That’s why I decided to focus around
distributed computing and system design, two areas I’m the most interested in.

Nowadays, I mostly use Python as a programming language of choice. However, I
keep an eye on Rust since I found it promising.

The best way to contact me is by sending an email to <ihor@kalnytskyi.com>. If
a need arises, you can prove my identify using [ECE7 D40B 49A5 F831] GPG key.
